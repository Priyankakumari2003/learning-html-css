        <h2>Something About This Website</h2>
        <p>
           Hii I am Priyanka Kumari currently pursuing B.Tech In Information Technology from CUSAT University.I made this website as a part of my first task in my Internship which is just to know about HTML and CSS.This website focuses on some men and women of India whose whole life is inspiration forThis website is a Parallax website which is a type of website design that creates an illusion of depth by having background images move slower than foreground images as the user scrolls down the page.It has been used for over a decade now and is not just another passing web design trend. Parallax websites create the same optical illusion as in real life where background elements are often set to move at much slower speeds than foreground elements. Unlike other interactive web design techniques requiring click-triggered animation, parallax scrolling bursts to life as you scroll up and down the page.
